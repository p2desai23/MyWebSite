One day, a guy named NAME went to a scary corn maze. He wasn’t one who got scared easily. His only fear was NOUNs. So he drove to the place, in his musty old CAR. When he arrived, he was greeted by a spooky NOUN. He got his ticket and went inside the maze, feeling courageous, and munching on SNACK. He took a few rights and lefts, and also got jump-scared by a few NOUNs. This is definitely not ADJECTIVE he thought to himself. That is when he saw the exit, but a big scary NOUN was blocking it. “Ahhhhhh!,” he screamed as he VERB. Hence, the title of this short story is called, TITLE!
