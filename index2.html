<h1> Avi's Irresistable Bevies! </h1>

 <h2> Hello there, my name is Avi Desai. When the Covid Pandemic hit, I started making juices with a Vitamix from scratch. These juices included fresh fruits and vegetables, along with a few herbs. Now that I have mastered some of my juices, I would love for others to enjoy it as much as I do! Below, I have some of my recipies that are high sellers. Below that, I have a spreadsheet which allows you to write your name down for which day you would want to pick up the juice, and accomadations to the juice as well. The act of substituting vegetables/fruits or taking them out or adding extra will be cost free. Please write these accomodations in the designated section, and if you have none, leave it blank. Write the allocated time and day you would like it, and I will have it ready for you. All the juice's will be put in the same size glass jar, of 14 ounces. Please return the jars as soon as possible. The amount of one juice amounts to 11 dollars. Please try to let me know a day ahead, although last minute orders are welcome. Thank you for taking your time to read this! </h2>
